## Overview
This repository is designed to perform various tasks, utilizing a context management system via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. It leverages a vector search mechanism (pgvector) to efficiently return relevant context chunks based on given queries.

## Key Components
1. **RAG Context Management**: The system uses a RAG approach to manage context data, allowing for seamless retrieval and integration of contextual information based on user inputs.

2. **pgvector Search**: This component performs vector-based searches to find relevant information chunks stored in a database, enhancing the application's ability to provide accurate responses based on queries.

## Installation
To set up the repository, ensure you have the necessary dependencies and environment configured. The specific installation instructions are not provided in the codebase. Please make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Python (version not specified)

Dependencies can be assumed to be included in a typical requirements file or installation process.

## Quick Start
As there are no specific usage examples or documentation found within the codebase, details on how to interact with the system or initiate the context retrieval process are not available. Users are encouraged to explore the core functionalities and integrate them as needed within their application environment.

For more specific examples and advanced usage, further documentation may be required externally or through additional files not present in this repository. 

Feel free to explore the source code for specific method invocations and integrations as they relate to your context management needs.
