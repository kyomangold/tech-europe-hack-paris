# Project Title

## Overview
This repository provides functionality for performing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context chunks via pgvector search. It allows the retrieval of context from a vector database, particularly useful for enhancing applications in natural language processing.

## Key Components
- **pgvector Search**: The core functionality revolves around searching for context chunks stored in a pgvector database, leveraging vector embeddings to improve information retrieval.

## Installation Instructions
To install this project, please follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (specific libraries would be listed in a requirements file or similar, but this information is currently not available).
3. Set up a pgvector database as per the requirements of your environment.

## Quick Start
As the specific usage instructions are not available in the provided context, a general usage outline could be as follows:
1. Initialize your pgvector database and upload your context data.
2. Import the necessary modules/functions from this repository.
3. Use the implemented functions to perform a search and retrieve context for your specific application.

**Note**: For detailed examples and specific function usage, further documentation or examples would typically be included in the codebase but are not currently accessible.
