# Repository Name

## Overview
This repository implements a system that allows for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via a PostgreSQL vector search mechanism. The primary purpose of the codebase is to facilitate RAG operations, likely to enhance responses beyond basic retrieval.

## Key Modules
- **rag**: This module is responsible for returning RAG context chunks based on a vector search in a PostgreSQL database. It forms the core functionality of the repository.

## Installation Instructions
To install this repository, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies. The specifics of these dependencies are not provided in the codebase, so please refer to a requirements file or package manager if available.

## Quick Start
To use the RAG functionality, you can call the `rag` function from the available module. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to do this:
```javascript
const { rag } = require('<module-path>');

// Call the rag function
rag()
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("Error: ", error);
  });
```

More specific usage and examples may be found within the module documentation or comments within the code.
