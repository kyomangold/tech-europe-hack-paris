# Repository Title

## Overview

This repository provides a simple interface for returning context chunks from a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using a pgvector search. It is designed to facilitate the integration of large language models with external data sources through efficient vector similarity searches.

## Key Modules

### Functions

- **rag**: This function retrieves context chunks relevant to a given query using a pgvector search. It's the main function to access the RAG capabilities of the repository.

## Installation Instructions

To install the necessary dependencies and set up the environment, please refer to the specific requirements and installation steps provided in your environment setup, as the details are not explicitly defined in the codebase.

## Quick Start

To get started with the RAG functionality:

1. **Initialize the RAG**: Call the `rag` function to begin fetching context chunks.
2. **Provide Input**: Ensure you have appropriate input parameters to pass to the function.

Example usage (specific input parameters are not provided, so this is a placeholder):

```javascript
const contextChunks = rag();
```

Further usage examples may require more context or configuration according to your application needs.
