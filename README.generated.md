# Project README

## Overview

This repository implements a system for retrieving context chunks using vector-based search with the `pgvector` extension. The primary functionality revolves around performing search queries that retrieve relevant context chunks based on a specific vectorized representation.

## Key Components

- **pgvector Search:** The core functionality allows for performing searches via the `pgvector` extension, which is tailored for working with vector embeddings in PostgreSQL.

## Installation Instructions

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed with the `pgvector` extension enabled. You can follow the official documentation to set up the extension.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Install any necessary dependencies as mentioned in the project setup.

## Quick Start

To use the functionality provided in this repository:

1. Set up your PostgreSQL database with the required schema including the vector column.
2. Insert the vector representations of the data you want to query against.
3. Run search queries using the provided methods to retrieve relevant context chunks based on input vectors.

*Note: For detailed usage and specific query examples, please refer to the code comments or documentation within the project files.* 

### Example Usage

```python
# Example code showing how to perform a search
# This is a placeholder; actual implementation will depend on the codebase

results = search_vectors(input_vector)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

*Further usage examples can be added once the specific querying functions are detailed in the implementation.*
