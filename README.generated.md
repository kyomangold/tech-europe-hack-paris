# Project Title

## Description
This repository is designed to perform RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) context chunk retrieval via a pgvector search. It facilitates the process of enhancing generative models with retrieved context to improve the relevance and accuracy of generated outputs.

## Key Components
- **RAG Functionality**: The main focus of this repository is to implement a search mechanism to retrieve context chunks using pgvector, enabling the generative models to leverage external information effectively.

## Installation Instructions
The installation steps are not explicitly mentioned in the codebase or context provided. However, typical steps would include:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Ensure that a `requirements.txt` file is present in the repository.)*

## Quick Start
The basic usage instructions for retrieving context chunks using the RAG functionality are not provided in the codebase or context. However, the typical initial usage pattern would look similar to:
```python
from rag_module import RAGFunction

rag_instance = RAGFunction()
context_chunks = rag_instance.retrieve_context(query)
print(context_chunks)
```
*Note: Replace `rag_module` with the actual module name implementing the RAG functionality.* 

Please refer to any additional documentation available within the repository for further usage details.
