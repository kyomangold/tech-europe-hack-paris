# Repository README

## Overview

This repository contains a project that implements functionality for similarity search using pgvector, enabling users to return context chunks based on vector embeddings. The primary purpose of this codebase is to facilitate efficient retrieval of relevant information in a structured format.

## Key Components

- **pgvector Integration**: The main component that enables vector similarity search capabilities. This likely involves database interactions where embeddings are stored and retrieved based on cosine similarity or other distance metrics.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project, please ensure that you have the necessary environment and dependencies installed. Specifically:

1. **Database Setup**: It may be necessary to have PostgreSQL set up with the pgvector extension.
2. **Dependencies**: Install any required libraries or dependencies as defined in the project files (e.g., `requirements.txt` or similar, if available).

As the specific dependencies are not outlined in the current codebase context, please refer to any associated files for a complete list of packages.

## Quick Start

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
   - Ensure that PostgreSQL is running and the pgvector extension is installed.

2. **Run Database Migrations**: If applicable, perform database migrations to set up the necessary tables.

3. **Start the Application**: Launch the application using the relevant command based on your setup (e.g., running a Python script or deploying via a web framework).

4. **Perform Similarity Searches**: Use the provided interface (likely through functions or an API endpoint) to conduct similarity searches on your vector embeddings.

For detailed usage examples, refer to the inline documentation or source files within the repository.

## Additional Information

For more details on the specific usage and functionality, please check the code directly, or any additional documentation that might be provided in the repository, as specific examples and detailed explanations are not included in this summary.
