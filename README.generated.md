# Best-In-Class â€“ AI Tutor

The Best-In-Class AI-powered tutor helps students master any subject using the Feynman technique - learning by teaching. The platform features a Next.js frontend and a Python backend with LiveKit and Beyond Presence integration for real-time, voice-based interactions. Students explain concepts in their own words, and the AI provides feedback, guidance, and targeted questions to deepen understanding. In "Teacher Mode," the AI can leverage the OpenAI Agents API to search the web or retrieve knowledge from provided PDFs (e.g., textbooks, lecture slides, class notes, flashcards, and more).

## Project Structure

### Backend
- `agent.py`: Main LiveKit agent implementation with Beyond Presence.
- `fastapi_backend.py`: Main backend implementation connecting everything to the frontend.
- `agents_openai.py`: OpenAI agent implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists of Python dependencies.

### Frontend
- Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Components:
  - `NoAgentNotification.tsx`: UI for when no agent is available.
  - `TranscriptionView.tsx`: Real-time transcription display for improved accessibility.
  - `CloseIcon.tsx`: UI component for closing modals.
- App Structure:
  - `app/page.tsx`: Main application page.
  - `app/layout.tsx`: Root layout component.
  - `app/api/`: API routes.
  - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.

## Features
- Real-time transcription for improved accessibility.
- Voice-based interactions using LiveKit and Beyond Presence.
- Teacher Mode powered by the OpenAI Agents API.
- Modular architecture with a clear separation of components for maintainability.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **Other Libraries**:
  - livekit: 1.0.8
  - python-dotenv: 1.1.0

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for frontend)
- npm (for package management in frontend)

## Installation

### Backend Setup
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install livekit-plugins-bey
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```bash
    # OpenAI API  
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

    # Livekit API  
    LIVEKIT_URL=...
    LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...
    LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...

    # Beyond Presence API
    BEY_API_KEY=sk-...
    BEY_AVATAR_ID=...
    ```

4. Run the Beyond Presence avatar backend:
    ```bash
    python agent.py dev
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd best-in-class-ai
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Start the FastAPI backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn fastapi_backend:app --reload
    ```

## Configuration
