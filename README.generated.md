## Overview
This repository provides functionality that allows the retrieval of context chunks using a vector similarity search. It leverages the `pgvector` extension for PostgreSQL to search and retrieve relevant information efficiently.

## Key Components
- **Vector Search**: The core functionality of this repository. It involves utilizing the `pgvector` extension to perform similarity searches on vectorized data.
- **Context Retrieval**: Implements methods to return context chunks based on query inputs.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed with the `pgvector` extension.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Follow any additional setup instructions as specified in the `setup.py` or similar files, if present.

## Quick Start
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database.
2. Create a table with a vector column using the `pgvector` extension.
3. Insert your vector data into the table.
4. Use the provided functions to perform a vector search to retrieve relevant context chunks from your dataset.

### Example
While specific usage examples are not present in the repository, generally, a typical search operation would look like this:
```python
# Example pseudocode for performing a search
results = perform_vector_search(query_vector)
print(results)
```

## Further Information
For detailed implementation details, please refer to the codebase and associated comments.
