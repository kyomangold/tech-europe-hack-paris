# Project Title

## Overview
This repository provides functionality for returning context chunks related to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via a PostgreSQL vector search.

## Key Components
- **functions**: The primary functionality is encapsulated within the `rag` function, which serves to retrieve context chunks from a database using vector search capabilities.

## Installation Instructions
To set up this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies. Ensure you have the required runtime environment:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Quick Start
To use the RAG functionality, you can invoke the `rag` function. This will return context chunks based on a vector search in PostgreSQL.

Example usage:
```javascript
const contextChunks = functions.rag();
```

Make sure to adjust the parameters as necessary based on your specific implementation and configuration.
