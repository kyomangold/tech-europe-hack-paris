## Description
This project serves as a foundational setup for implementing artificial intelligence (AI) components and applications, utilizing advanced tools and libraries such as LiveKit for real-time communication in Python. 

## Features
- Integration with LiveKit for real-time communication capabilities.
- Custom hooks for audio and transcription management.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or newer
- External dependencies:
  - `livekit==1.0.8`
  - `python-dotenv==1.1.0`

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For UNIX or macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration
No specific configuration files were found in the project. If your application requires configurations, consider creating a `.env` file using `python-dotenv` to manage your environment variables.

## Usage
Currently, there are no examples provided in the codebase indicating how to use the application. You may create your own usage examples based on the hooks defined in the `hooks` directory such as:

### Example Usage of Hooks
Here’s how you can implement the hooks in your component:

```javascript
import { useLocalMicTrack } from '../hooks/useLocalMicTrack';
import { useCombinedTranscriptions } from '../hooks/useCombinedTranscriptions';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const micTrack = useLocalMicTrack();
    const transcriptions = useCombinedTranscriptions();
    
    // Further logic here
};
```
