# Best-In-Class â€“ AI Tutor

An AI-powered tutor that helps students master any subject using the Feynman technique - learn by teaching. The platform features a Next.js frontend and a Python backend with LiveKit and Beyond Presence integration for real-time, voice-based interactions. Students explain concepts in their own words; the AI provides feedback, guidance, and targeted questions to deepen understanding. In "Teacher Mode," the AI can leverage the OpenAI Agents API to search the web for more information or retrieve knowledge from a provided PDF (e.g., textbook, lecture slides, and more).

## Features
- Real-time voice-based interactions
- AI feedback on student explanations
- Teacher Mode for searching and retrieving information

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Python
- **Dependencies**:
  - LiveKit: `livekit==1.0.8`
  - Dotenv for environment variable management: `python-dotenv==1.1.0`

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- Knowledge of Next.js and Python development

## Installation
### Backend Setup
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install livekit-plugins-bey
    ```

3. Create `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```plaintext
    # OpenAI API  
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

    # Livekit API  
    LIVEKIT_URL=...
    LIVEKIT_API_KEY=...
    LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=...

    # Beyond Presence API
    BEY_API_KEY=sk-...
    BEY_AVATAR_ID=...
    ```

4. Run the Beyond Presence avatar backend:
    ```bash
    python agent.py dev
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd best-in-class-ai
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Start the FastAPI backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn fastapi_backend:app --reload
    ```
