## Information Flows Analysis

### Overview
The application has various information flows within its internal components and possibly with external systems. Below is an analysis of the detected information flows based on the architecture diagram provided.

### 1. **Application Information Flow**
- **Source:** User Interface (UI)
- **Destination:** Backend Services
- **Data Type:** User Input/Requests
- **Purpose:** To send user commands and queries to the backend for processing.

### 2. **Backend Processing Flow**
- **Source:** Backend Services
- **Destination:** Database
- **Data Type:** Data Queries/Updates
- **Purpose:** To retrieve and store data based on requests received from the user interface.

### 3. **Data Retrieval Flow**
- **Source:** Database
- **Destination:** Backend Services
- **Data Type:** Data Records
- **Purpose:** To provide data required for constructing responses to user requests.

### 4. **Response Flow**
- **Source:** Backend Services
- **Destination:** User Interface (UI)
- **Data Type:** Processed Data/Responses
- **Purpose:** To send back the results of user requests, updating the user interface accordingly.

### Unknown or Inferred Relationships
- There are potential external systems that may interact with both the backend services and the database, but specific data flows are not provided in the current context. These interactions need further specification for clarity.
