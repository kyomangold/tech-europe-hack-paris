# Architecture Overview

The architecture of the software system examined is built around a **FastAPI backend**, designed to facilitate various endpoints for managing study-related functionality. The architecture diagram represents the application, but specific components and their interactions are notably minimal from the information accessible in the codebase.

### Explanation:
- `Application`: Represents the core backend system responsible for handling various study-related operations through RESTful APIs.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack identified in this project includes:

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for creating APIs in Python, known for its performance and ease of use.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the backend services.
- **.env configuration**: Utilized for managing environment variables (noted in the `.env.example` file).

## Component Architecture

The main components of the system are defined through API endpoints, primarily managed in `fastapi_backend.py`. These endpoints facilitate various functionalities related to study planning, progress tracking, and materials handling. 

### Key Endpoints:
1. **POST** `/api/give-more-info`: Provides additional information.
2. **POST** `/api/upload-study-material`: Endpoint to upload study materials.
3. **POST** `/api/create-topic`: For creating study topics.
4. **GET** `/api/study-sessions`: Retrieves study sessions.
5. **GET** `/api/topics`: Fetches the list of topics.
6. **GET** `/api/current-topic`: Retrieves the current topic of the study session.

## Data Architecture

The specific data storage solutions or database schemas were not clearly identified in the codebase. There seems to be a standard approach to handling relational data patterns, given that FastAPI typically interacts with databases through ORM or direct queries.

## API Architecture

The following RESTful API endpoints were identified:

- **POST** and **GET** methods for creating and retrieving information regarding study sessions, topics, and metrics.
- The API structure follows REST conventions, though specific authentication mechanisms were not documented in the provided code.

### API Endpoints Summary
- **/api/connection-details**: GET
- **/api/study-planner**: POST
- **/api/topic-progress**: GET
- **/api/create-topic**: POST
- **/api/upload-study-material**: POST
- **/api/current-session**: GET, POST
- **/api/study-goals**: GET
- **/api/study-metrics**: GET

## Security Architecture

Details regarding security measures such as authentication and authorization were not evident from the available codebase. There is a lack of specific patterns observed in relation to securing the API endpoints.

## Deployment Architecture

No deployment configuration or containerization options (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) were found within the codebase. The only configuration visible was a `.env.example` for environment variables. Additionally, there was no CI/CD configuration observed.

## Architectural Patterns

The architectural pattern is classified as **unknown**, with no clear separation of concerns established among the components based on what was found in the codebase. FastAPI itself promotes a modular structure, but specific design implementations were not discernible.

## Key Design Decisions

- The choice of **FastAPI** for building the backend indicates an emphasis on performance and modern asynchronous capabilities.
- A simple REST API structure has been established for handling various operations, though detailed design patterns were not explicitly utilized or recorded in the codebase. 

In summary, this architectural documentation provides a foundational view of the project based on observable components and functionalities. Further information regarding interactions and explicit design decisions may be needed for a comprehensive architectural overview.
