# Architecture Overview
The system is architected as a web application utilizing a FastAPI backend that interacts with various external components to perform its functions. The architecture is designed to support educational goals through managing topics, study sessions, and materials. The system enables users to create, manage, and retrieve information related to their study experiences via API calls.

## System Architecture Diagram

In the architecture diagram, the following components are illustrated:

- **FastAPI Backend**: The core of the application, responsible for handling client requests and providing API endpoints for various functionalities.
- **External Agents**: These interact with the backend to perform operations related to topics, sessions, and study metrics. Each external agent is denoted by dashed arrows, indicating they operate outside the main backend flow.
- **API Connections**: The backend includes numerous API endpoints for functionality, such as:
  - `_api_current_topic`
  - `_api_study_goals`
  - `_api_upload_study_material`
These APIs facilitate communication with the frontend and external systems.

## Technology Stack
The following technologies, frameworks, and libraries are utilized within the codebase:

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python, chosen for its speed and ease of use.
- **OpenAI API**: Integrated for enhancing the educational experience by leveraging AI capabilities.
- **Databases**: While not specified in the architecture, database interactions are likely through ORM or direct querying, based on common practices in FastAPI applications.
- **Frontend Framework (assumed)**: The architecture includes references to an external frontend API on `http://localhost:3000`, indicating a possible integration with a JavaScript-based front-end framework (though specifics are not confirmed).

## Component Architecture
### Main Components:
1. **FastAPI Backend**: 
   - Handles API requests and business logic.
   - Integrates with external agents for functionality.
   - Exposes multiple API endpoints for CRUD operations on topics and studies.
  
2. **External Agents**:
   - Various external agents interact with the backend for specific tasks (e.g., fetching metadata, handling session data, managing user study goals).
  
### Interaction:
The interactions among the components are primarily through RESTful API calls. The backend communicates with external services using defined endpoints, allowing for modular interactions with other components in the system.

## Data Architecture
The codebase does not provide explicit details on data storage solutions or database schemas. However, it can be inferred that there is a need for persistent storage for:
- User study topics
- Session data
- Metrics associated with study goals

Data flow likely involves REST API calls to retrieve and store this information.

## API Architecture
The system defines several critical API endpoints, primarily around study topics and sessions. Some of these include:
- **`/api_current_topic`**: Retrieves the current topic being studied.
- **`/api_study_goals`**: Manages user-defined study objectives.
- **`/api_upload_study_material`**: Handles file uploads related to study resources.

## Security Architecture
No specific security implementations or measures are observed in the current codebase. However, it is common practice to implement authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2 or JWT tokens in API-based architectures, especially when user data is involved.

## Deployment Architecture
The deployment aspects are not detailed within the provided codebase or initial analysis. However, given the nature of a FastAPI application, it could be containerized using Docker, and deployed on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure for scalability and availability.

## Architectural Patterns
The codebase exhibits features of a layered architecture, where:
- The FastAPI acts as the controller for handling requests.
- The different services (external agents) fulfill various responsibilities in a modular manner.

This separation allows for easier maintenance and potential scaling of the application.

## Key Design Decisions
- The choice of FastAPI as the primary framework provides asynchronous capabilities, which may influence performance positively compared to traditional frameworks.
- The integration with external services reflects a microservices-oriented approach, allowing for the extensibility of the application through independent components.
- The use of RESTful APIs aids in standardization and interoperability with various clients and services.
