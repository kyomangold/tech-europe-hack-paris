# Architecture Overview

This documentation outlines the architecture for a FastAPI-based application that serves as a backend to facilitate various study-related activities. The architecture employs a straightforward microservices approach, allowing for modular design and flexible interactions between different components.

## System Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the main components of the system and their interactions:

### Components Explained
- **fastapi_backend**: The primary backend service built using FastAPI. It handles incoming requests for study session management, topics, and associated resources.
- **agents_openai**: A service that likely interacts with OpenAI's API to facilitate advanced features such as natural language processing or intelligent responses.
- **external components**: Various endpoints (such as `_api_create_topic`, `_api_upload_study_material`, etc.) that the FastAPI service interacts with to manage the application's functionality. Each of these components is responsible for specific API interactions related to study management.

## Technology Stack

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python, known for its speed and automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation.
- **OpenAI API**: Used for AI-driven features, suggesting that the application may include machine learning or NLP functionalities.
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL (if applicable)**: Common backend databases for storing session and topic data, though specific DB technology is not mentioned in the provided diagram.
- **Docker (if applicable)**: If applicable, for containerization of the API and services; though not explicitly defined, modern architectures typically utilize Docker.

## Component Architecture

The system is composed of a few essential modules:
1. **FastAPI Backend**: Responsible for:
   - Handling authentication and authorization (not detailed in the codebase but typically expected).
   - Providing RESTful endpoints for the front-end.
   - Managing communication with the OpenAI agents.
   - Processing user data for study sessions, topics, and evaluations.
   
2. **OpenAI Agents**: Designed to process user queries and provide data-driven insights for topics and lessons based on natural language understanding.
   
3. **External APIs**: The various endpoints that the FastAPI backend interacts with (e.g., for creating topics, uploading materials, etc.).

## Data Architecture

The codebase does not explicitly describe the data storage solutions or database schemas utilized, but it is typical to find:
- **Relational databases** (like PostgreSQL or MySQL) for structured data like user sessions and topics.
- **NoSQL databases** (like MongoDB) might also be used if the application requires flexibility in data structure.

## API Architecture

The application exposes multiple RESTful API endpoints, as depicted in the architecture diagram. The naming conventions suggest CRUD operations with endpoints like:
- `/api/create_topic`
- `/api/study_sessions`
- `/api/upload_study_material`
These would typically employ standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manage resources effectively.

## Security Architecture

While no explicit security mechanisms were detailed in the provided architecture, general security considerations for FastAPI applications include:
- **OAuth2 or JWT** for authenticating users.
- HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- Input validation and sanitation to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

## Deployment Architecture

There is no explicit deployment architecture mentioned, but a modern deployment might include:
- **Docker** containers for encapsulating the FastAPI application.
- **Kubernetes** or **Docker Compose** for orchestrating the deployment of multiple services.
- Deployment on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for flexibility and scalability.

## Architectural Patterns

The application follows a **microservices architecture**. This pattern enables separation of concerns by splitting functionalities into independent components, allowing for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability.

## Key Design Decisions

Notable architectural decisions include:
1. The choice of FastAPI for its high performance and ease of use for RESTful APIs.
2. Leveraging OpenAIâ€™s API integration for enhancing user interaction and enriching study sessions outside traditional methods.
3. Clear modularity, allowing independent deployment and scaling of backend services. 

This documentation provides a structured overview of the architecture based on the existing codebase while adhering to best practices. Further documentation may elaborate on specific modules and components as required.
